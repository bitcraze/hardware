{% datasheet_intro Breakout-deck-400px-1_1024x1024.jpeg; %}
Test new hardware easily without soldering by using the breakout expansion board. Just build
the circuit on a breadboard and attach a Crazyflie family product to it.
{% enddatasheet_intro %}

## Introduction

The Breakout deck has all the 20 expansion connector pins available as well as a footprint
where a 1-wire memory could be soldered to make the board auto-detectable by the firmware.

The board is designed to fit on a prototyping breadboard.

## Features

* SOT-23 footprint for 1-wire memory used for automatic detection (not mounted)
* All 20 pins in the deck expansion port available
* 2.54mm header that fits a breadboard (not included)
* Screen-print showing all signal names

## Electrical specification
