20dBm power amplifier and LNA.
{% enddatasheet_intro %}

## Introduction

The Crazyradio 2.0 is not only for usage together with the Crazyflie family of devices, since
it's an open project with open firmware and a Python API, it's a great
building block for systems that require more predictable latency compared to WiFi and doesn't have the same
requirements for bandwidth. The hardware comes with a
bootloader that enables firmware upgrades via USB without any additional hardware needed.

The Crazyradio 2.0 is compatible with the Crazyflie eco system.
