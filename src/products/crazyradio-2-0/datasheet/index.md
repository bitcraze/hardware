{% enddatasheet_intro %}

## Introduction

The Crazyradio 2.0 is not only for usage together with the Crazyflie and Crazyflie 2.X. Since
it's an open project with firmware written from scratch and a Python API for usage it's great
building block for systems that require more predictable latency compared to WiFi and doesn't have the same
requirements for bandwidth. The hardware comes with a
bootloader that enables firmware upgrades via USB without any additional hardware needed.

The Crazyradio 2.0 is compatible with Crazyflie 2.x products.
