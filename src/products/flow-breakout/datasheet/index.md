The Flow breakout board is used for motion tracking and can easily be connected to any robotics
project or other design.
{% enddatasheet_intro %}

## Introduction

The motion of a surface, usually the ground, is measured and is reported as delta X, delta Y by
the optical flow sensor. The Z absolute distance is measured by the Time of Flight ranging sensor.
It comes with an Arduino library to easily read the movement data and has a large voltage range
for IO and power supply.

The Flow breakout features the VL53L0x ToF sensor and the PMW3901 optical flow sensor.

## Features

* Fast, accurate distance ranging
* Measures absolute range up to 2m
* Measures movement in X/Y using optical sensor
* Power supply and IO 3V - 5V compatible
* Arduino library for easy usage
* Minimum range for motion tracking is 80mm

## Electrical specification

* VL53L0x ToF sensor (I2C)
* PMW3901 optical flow sensor (SPI)
* VCC: 3V - 5V

* Compatible with 3 to 5V system (power and IO)
* Optical flow requires an SPI port
* ToF ranger requires an I2C port
