{% datasheet_intro prototyping-deck-400px-3_1024x1024.jpg; %}
Add a prototyping area to your Crazyflie 2.X and lift your electronics into the air.
Just solder directly on the expansion board and plug it to the expansion port.

## Introduction

The Prototyping deck has special pads to make it easier to solder, bride and prototype new
functionality. The deck also has a footprint
where a 1-wire memory could be soldered to make the board auto-detectable by the firmware.

All the soldering pads are spaced with 2.54 mm.

## Features

* Soldering pads support both though hole and SMD components
* Has SOT-23 footprint for 1-wire memory used for automatic detection (not mounted)

## Electrical specification

* Makes all 20 pins in the Crazyflie 2.X expansion port available
* 40 pads for prototyping (supporting both though hole and SMD components)
* Footprint for optional 1-wire memory (not mounted)

## Mechanical specifications

* Weight: 1.5 g
* Size (BxHxW): 28x28x4mm
* Designed for mounting above or under the Crazyflie 2.X
